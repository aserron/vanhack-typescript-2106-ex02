# Integer Partitions
In number theory and combinatorics, a partition of a positive integer nis a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.

Two sums that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same partition.

For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:

`4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1,` and` 1 + 1 + 1 + 1`.

We can write:

> enum(4) -> [[4],[3,1],[2,2],[2,1,1],[1,1,1,1]] and
>   
> enum(5) -> [[5],[4,1],[3,2],[3,1,1],[2,2,1],[2,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1]].

## Your Task
The number of parts in a partition grows very fast.  
For `n = 50` number of parts is 204226, but for 80 it is 15,796,476.   
It would be too long to tests answers with arrays of such size.
 
So your task is the following:

### 1. Enumerate
Given an integer n `(1 ≤ n ≤ 50)`, calculate the partition of `n`.  
You will obtain something like:

   `enum(n)` -> `[[n],[n-1,1],[n-2,2],...,[1,1,...,1]]`  
(order of array and sub-arrays doesn't matter)

The result of this part is not tested.

### 2. Calculate the Product
   For each sub-array of `enum(n)` calculate its product.   
   If `n = 5` (after removing duplicates and sorting) we'll obtain:

   - prod(5) -> `[1,2,3,4,5,6]`
   - prod(8) -> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18]`    

   If `n = 40`, then `prod(n)` has a length of `2699`,   
   so once again, this is not directly tested.

   The result of this part is not tested.

### 3. Return the Stats
   Return the Range, the Average (Mean) and the Median of step 2 in the following form  

   **(example for n = 5):**

      "Range: 5 Average: 3.50 Median: 3.50"

         Range is an integer,   
         Average and Median are float numbers rounded to two decimal places (.2f in some languages).

## Definitions

### Range : 
The difference between the highest and lowest values.


### Average (or Mean):   
To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers  
in a set and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.

### Median : 
The median is the number separating the higher half  
of a data sample from the lower half. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)

## Hints
Try to optimize your program to avoid timing out.
Memoization can be helpful but it is not mandatory for being successful.
